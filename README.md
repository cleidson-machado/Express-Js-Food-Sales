## About the Developer

Hi! My Name is CLEIDSON P. MACHADO

I am a Developer and Systems Analyst. I have recent real experience working with legacy web systems using Nodejs, Javascript, NuxtJS, NodeJS, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, TypeORM, NestJS and PHP. I have already programmed in JAVA and Delphi (Pascal) in advanced projects and studies. I am currently looking for job opportunities as a Developer in Web Systems and Mobile Applications but I am willing to work in any area in which my professional profile can be used.

I am a qualified and results-oriented professional, with solid real-world experience. I have two degrees in my country, Brazil; The first as a journalist and the second as a Systems Analyst. I have proven ability to evaluate and manage complex topics and am seen as a strong problem solver. I have already achieved success in intense and demanding environments, being a leader in the teams I worked in, helping to motivate and develop solutions. I am willing to change regions, inside or outside the country, if the vacancy requires it or for remote job positions.

I have a YouTube Channel where, in a special PlayList, I comment on advanced Programming topics in the NODEJS environment to prove my portfolio: (`https://www.youtube.com/@CleidsonMachadoDeveloper`)

I also have a good number of projects in my GITHub Repository, many of which are complete and Fullstack in JAVA, PHP, NODEJS and Delphi. Here is the link: (`https://github.com/cleidson-machado?tab=repositories`)

Create the app:

```bash
$ express --view=hbs /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Start your app.js app at `http://localhost:3000/`:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```
